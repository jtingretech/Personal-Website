# Personal Website

This contains all the resources and code for my personal portfolio website. The result is a fairly minimalistic and responsive personal website aimed to be both visually appealing and functional. This is the first real website that I have built from scratch all the way to deployment. There are definitely areas in my code that could be made more efficient (feel free to let me know).

## Getting Started

This website utilizes fairly standard **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** languages. 

Packages/frameworks needed to run on local machine:
```
- Node.js
- NPM
- particles.js
- npmjs
```

### Installing

**If you already have Node.js / NPM installed, you can skip this section.**

I used [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage all my installations on my Mac machine. 

Installing [Node.js/NPM using Homebrew](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac):
Type the following in your terminal.
```
brew install node
```
Check installation:
Type the following in your terminal.
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
I also used [VincentGarreau's](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) >lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.

In order to see this library in action on your browser, a live server will need to be running on your machine. I used a temporary live server with [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

Installing npmjs globally:
Type the following in your terminal.
```
npm install -g live-server
```
To run a temporary live server:
Type the following in your terminal.
```
live-server
```
## Deployment

Coming soon!

I must tip my hat off to owners of any code, frameworks, media used that I do not own.
